# LowPolyMotion
> Implementing simple low polygon dynamics through low-level and complex code.

这个小动效是四年前我在高中时开发的，因为当时我对腾讯QQ登录页面的动画很感兴趣，因此尝试对其进行了实现。虽然这份代码实现并不高效，但是这个个人的尝试激发了我对计算机图形学与算法的热情，这对我来说非常有意义，因此我把它作为我在Github上发布的第一个仓库。

This project was developed four years ago when I am in high school because I was interested in the animation of Tencent QQ login page at that time. Although this code implementation is not very efficient, this project has inspired my enthusiasm for computer graphics and algorithms, which is very meaningful to me, so I make it as my first repository released on Github.

另外，虽然这段代码是四年前写的，但为了不让显示效果和效率太差，我还是对原版本做了一些必要的修改，并使用C#进行了复现，也就是你现在看到的C#版本。

In addition, although this code was written four years ago, in order not to make the effect and efficiency too bad, I made some necessary modify to the original version and used C# to reproduce, and this is the C# version you see now.
